# Final Exam Readme as outlined on Canvas

## Submission Overview

I opted to focus on completing the C and B level features outlined on the Canvas assignment.  I chose not to shoot for an A or go for the stretch points of having a creative and immersive world because I had a 50 point surplus in the course.  I'm also pretty over the whole RPG game thing and I didn't want to stress myself out over having to come up with a creative world that I wasn't actually into.

### C level features:

Users can add abilities to players, attack using their equipment based damage, and do damage to monsters using their abilities.  I used the list of features from the Canvas rubric before seeing that there was this whole separate README file so I hope you can show some mercy while grading. For instance I didn't use spectre on some of the initial C level work (it wasn't outlined on Canvas but was mentioned somewhere deep in the README here).

I did use Spectre and the AnsiConsole.MarkUpLine method throughout the remaining B level features.  The Canvas assignment didn't specify this and by the time I was reading the README.md I considered myself done with the C and B level work.

### B level features:

Users can display, look up, and create rooms with associated exits.

I opted out of doing any monster or player inclusions as it was labelled "optional" and I only wanted to do the rubric points for the C and B level features.

I added two rooms at first: smoke room and a bakery.  I didn't include any exits on the smokeroom but included two exits on the bakery.  I didn't really sit and play the game though and didn't go for the stretch goal of creating an immersive world.

### A level features:

I opted out of going for an A since I was sitting at a +50 point surplus in the gradebook.  Ultimately I found it harder to stay focused the more we talked about game characters and worlds.

### A+ Stretch Level Features: Creative World Design?

"The exam evaluates your ability to create an **immersive game world**. "

I opted out of spending extra time trying to build an immersive and fun game.   I spent a lot of the course wishing we were doing a more real world reporting style application and I'm glad that Canvas outlines the creative world stuff as A+ stretch goal.

## Future Course Feedback

Maybe consider changing:

* Offer bitsql database access immediately.
    * I understand this may not have been possible for some reason but it would have been a major nice-to-have earlier rather than later

* Lower emphasis on game design creativity
    * I struggled to stay interested after a while and would have liked clearer cut assignment guidelines.

* Brush up on a solid set of VS Code configurations and ensure all assignment templates run smoothely outside of a Windows Visual Studio environment.  I had a lot of surprises and had to pay closer attention to working directories when multi-project solutions were involved.

* Offer a non-RPG game option.  I'm sure some people really liked it and I'm sure it works but I personally really didn't like writing code about goblins and dragons.  It created too much room for blurry lines on how entities should be designed and interact with one another and I second guessed myself a lot when I didn't agree with certain template decisions.
