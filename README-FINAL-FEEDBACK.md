# Final Exam Readme as outlined on Canvas

## Submission Overview
I opted to focus on completing the C and B level features outlined on the Canvas assignment.  I chose not to shoot for an A or go for the stretch points of having a creative and immersive world because I had a 50 point surplus in the course.  I'm also pretty over the whole RPG game thing 

### C level features:

Users can add abilities to players, attack using their equipment based damage, and do damage to monsters using their abilities.  I used the list of features from the Canvas rubric before seeing that you had this whole separate README file so I hope you keep that in mind while grading. For instance I didn't use spectre on some of the initial C level work (it wasn't outlined on Canvas).

I did use Spectre and the AnsiConsole.MarkUpLine method throughout the remaining B level features.  The Canvas assignment didn't specify this and by the time I was reading the README.md I considered myself done with the C and B level work.

### B level features:

Users can display, look up, and create rooms with associated exits.

I opted out of doing any monster or player inclusions as it was labelled "optional" and I only wanted to do the rubric points for the C and B level features.

I added two rooms at first: smoke room and a bakery.  I didn't include any exits on the smokeroom but included two exits on the bakery.  I had no desire to sit and play the game though nor to go for the stretch goal of creating a personalized creative and immersive game world.

By the end of the B level features I didn't want to sit here "playing" a console application.

### A level features:

I opted out of going for an A since I was sitting at a +50 point surplus in the gradebook.  Ultimately I was fed up with the RPG theme long ago and I am just shooting for the B based on the requirements within Canvas.

### A+ Stretch Level Features: Creative World Design?

"The exam evaluates your ability to create an **immersive game world**. "

I opted out of spending time trying to build an immersive and fun game.  It's a console game and wouldn't have been fun for me anyway.  I spent most of the course wishing we were doing a more real world reporting style application and I'm glad that Canvas outlines the creative world stuff as A+ stretch goal.

## Future Course Feedback

Maybe consider changing:

* Offer bitsql database access immediately.
    * I understand this may not have been possible for some reason but it would have been a major nice-to-have earlier rather than later

* Lower emphasis on game design creativity
    * The reality is this class was accidentally designed for compliance with the templates and if you didn't want to create a game where users moved into a room and fought monsters it would not have been feasible without lots of extra time speant.

* Offer a non-RPG game option.
    * I don't look forward to telling recruiters "I built a game!" and then explaining what it was.

* Brush up on a solid set of VS Code configurations and ensure all assignment templates run smoothely outside of a Windows Visual Studio environment.  I don't just mean run either, make sure you can run the debugger on the base assignment template.

* Again, offer a non-RPG game option.  I'm sure some people really liked it and I'm sure it works but I personally really didn't like writing code about goblins and dragons.  It created too much room for blurry lines on how entities should be designed and interact with one another.
